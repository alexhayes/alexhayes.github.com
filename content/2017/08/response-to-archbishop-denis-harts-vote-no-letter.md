Summary: After reading Archbishop Denis Hart's "Vote No" letter and I needed to respond, even I'm the only one to read it, for cathartic release.

I find the debate about marriage equality disgraceful. There should be no debate. If two people want to get married and they are of the same sex why is that actually a problem?!
 
This blog post will focus on Archbishop Denis Hart's [open pastoral letter](http://www.theage.com.au/interactive/2017/misc/ArchbishopLetter.pdf) to urge Catholics to vote "No" in the upcoming plebiscite on marriage equality - or lack thereof as it now stands. If you'd prefer to read reporting on the issue rather than opinion The Age has published [an article](http://www.theage.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/just-say-no-archbishop-denis-hart-rallies-catholics-over-vital-wedding-poll-20170824-gy36z7.html) about it.

----

Honestly, there is so much divisive language in the Archbishop's letter I feel it's just leading people up the garden path.

> Indeed, so much of what is cherished as good in our society is, in fact, the fruit of Christian culture.

I'm not going to deny that there are many good (and bad) things in our culture that has derived from Christian culture, but really? Whose culture? Yours? There are lots of good things in my life that are not the fruit of Christian culture. In fact, probably quite a few things I find enjoyment in were once (probably still) regarded as sin by more than one faith, including your own. Does that make me a bad person? I don't think so and I'd imagine most people that _I_ consider have "good will" would think so also. Perhaps I just live in a bubble and all the people I believe have good will are actually bad people in your eyes? Perhaps.

> So, we want our ‘story’ to continue to be heard in all the great debates about the foundations of our society

That's right, it's a "story". Someone just made this stuff up. Just because you believe it does not make it fact. Honestly I don't care if you believe this "story" because if your life is better because of it then I think that's a good thing! As long as you aren't hurting anyone by adhering to your "story" then that's fine by me. But you have to understand, to a non-believer it's just a story. Someone wrote down that _your_ definition of marriage is between a man and woman. This doesn't give you the right to deny someone else's definition of marriage.

> We have always sought to contribute to our society as good citizens. We strive to act and speak out for the common good especially for the poorest and suffering among us.

And for this I thank you. As I would anyone who strives to attain such endeavour.

> We seek to cherish the dignity of the human person and support all in need: especially families, our indigenous brothers and sisters, migrants, refugees and all who need the compassion and mercy of Christ.

The important part in this sentence is the last part: "and all who need the compassion and mercy of Christ". So the people who seek compassion but not from Christ don't have as much dignity? This is a common theme: people who aren't of a particular faith or don't believe in _our_ one true God are somehow not as worthy. I just find this concept completely at odds with what _I_ consider to be good traits in a person.
 
> The Catholic Church, along with other faith traditions, teaches that marriage is a natural institution established by God to be a permanent union between one man and one woman, intended towards the formation of a family in which children are born and nurtured.
 
Cool. That's what you teach. You can contribute in the debate sure, whatever blows your hair back, but it doesn't grant you license to dictate what you teach over the many people who aren't listening (and adhering to) your teachings.

> It is vital that we Catholics vote, so that our viewpoint can be heard on this vital public issue.

Honestly I don't think there should be a vote. It's only going to create more divides in society. We elect politicians to do a job. They should have the courage to make progress not kowtow to a scaremongering.

> Its outcome will affect our society and families profoundly in the future.

Yes. If "No" wins this will certainly be a tragedy of epic proportions.

Perhaps we should look at what is happening in other societies that have already passed some kind of marriage equality. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage) "same-sex marriage is legally recognized (nationwide or in some parts) in the following countries: Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, France, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the United States and Uruguay".

I'm not hearing much about the sky falling from that list of countries since they legalised same-sex marriage. Perhaps I'm not exposed to it like you are but this is my point. You're making a great big issue out of something that, if history is anything to go by, will be be a complete non-issue in the future. Hell, in 2000 years time someone may have even written another "story" that supports same-sex marriage which large groups of believe in...

> Do our children also have rights? We are all children of a male and a female. Should not this be a central consideration in our decisions about the way children should be ideally nurtured and educated in our society.
 
Firstly, of course children have rights! And yes, it's true that we are all children of a male and a female.

However many children of a **male and a female** are brought up in situations of neglect. Probably a good portion of these people are even married by your Church (shock horror!).

The point is, marriage doesn't instantly give you the ability to be a better parent. Nor does following a particular faith. 

I'm not sure you can fully understand the difficulties of parenting but I believe love, attention, understanding, guidance, nurture, stability, wisdom and support are all qualities that will help children. These aren't exclusive qualities of a man and a woman being wed. They aren't exclusive qualities of even people being married.

> Things can be equal in all respects without having to be uniformly the same.

I'm not sure I understand this statement in the context of this debate but it's an argument that I'm hearing from 'No' voters and I think it's really to justify unjustifiable thoughts. In the context of this vote, things can't be equal if they aren't the same. If a woman and man are allowed to marry and a man and a man, or a woman and a woman are not, that is not equal. Plain and simple. If civil partnerships were regarded as the same as marriage by the community then we wouldn't be having this vote.

> We sincerely believe that there is a core and fundamental wisdom and truth in the traditional definition and understanding of marriage that should not be ignored and is worth keeping for the health and future of our society.

And that is fine. You can have this belief. But what, apart from your belief, is stopping someone else from having the opposing belief? Why is it that your beliefs can impinge upon others?

> Some will naturally be disappointed in our stance. Some even question our right to speak and follow our consciences.
 
I am disappointed by your lack of compassion and love for all people based upon their sexual orientation. I don't however question your right to speak. I do however question your logic about how you've come to your conclusion.

> It is entirely possible future legislation about same-sex marriage could infringe fundamental human rights of freedom of religion and conscience.
 
Don't we have the exact opposite of that right now? You are infringing on someone else's human rights by denying them something they perhaps want dearly. I think it's perhaps pretty clear where I stand on this. You should be allowed to make decisions about you you 'believe' should be married by your Church. I don't have a problem with that. But surely that net isn't allowed to cast over the whole population.

> It could result in restrictions on the right of ministers of religion and religious bodies and organisations having the freedom to teach, preach and speak about marriage between persons of the same sex being contrary to their religious or conscientious beliefs.

It's OK to discriminate though when it's something _you_ believe in right?
 
> We as a church affirm the dignity of all those who identify as having a same sex orientation. Like all human beings they are created in the image and likeness of God. They have a right to expect to be loved and welcomed and not subject to unjust discrimination.
>
> So where do we go from here?
>
> In all our conversations and encounters, let us imitate Pope Francis, who asks us to be humble and never judgemental.
>
> In that spirit, the Catholic Church will continue to teach and preach the truth that marriage is a union of one man and one woman and encourage all people of good will to embrace the fullness of that truth. 

In a couple of sentences you've gone from _all humans have a right to expect to be loved and welcomed and not subject to unjust discrimination_ to _we'll subject these people to unjust discrimination because this important guy told us to be humble and never judgemental_. That makes absolutely no rational sense at all.

Putting the word "truth" in there is just absolutely outrageous. This is your truth, not mine, not someone else's. Also implying that people only have good will if they embrace your version of the "truth" is grotesque.

Sorry, in my opinion (perhaps not just mine) humans aren't created in the image and likeness of God. Humans are created by a man and woman having sex. I completely agree however that all humans "have a right to expect to be loved and welcomed and not subject to unjust discrimination".
